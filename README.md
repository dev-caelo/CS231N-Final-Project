# CS231N-Final-Project
CS231N Final Project: Lung Cancer Detection in Images

## Architecture
For this project, we will be utilizing the following pre-trained models to perform feature
extraction on our lung cancer dataset: `ConvNeXt`, `EfficientNet`, and `AlexNet`. We will also
be constructing our own CNN architecture and passing all models into the following classifiers:  
Softmax, SVM, and PCA + SVM
